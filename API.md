INTERNAL GENE API SPEC (1.0)


Goal: Lead to emergent genetic effects instead of single programmed rules


Gene "effect" -- A number that represents the gene's relative strength


Gene "expression" A number that represents the gene's expressions.  Each expression ties into a "stat" each stat factors into behaviors and each behavior leads to outcomes (life, death, reproduction)

Example:

Aggression > Partner-Finding Expression > Mating Behavoir > Reproduction
